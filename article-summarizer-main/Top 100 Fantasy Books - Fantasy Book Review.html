<p><p><strong>International Fantasy Award Winner:</strong> 1957</p><p>The Lord of the Rings is unquestionably one of the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century. J. R. R. Tolkien&rsquo;s epic, written using a beautifully descriptive narrative, tells an enchanting tale of friendship, love and heroism.

<h2>4. <a href="/Susanna-Clarke/Jonathan-Strange-Mr-Norrell.html">Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke</a></h2>
<p><p>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell is a genuinely original story, beautifully told. The Telegraph succinctly says it all with &#39;an elegant and witty historical fantasy which deserves to be judged on its own (considerable) merit&#39;. It is unquestionably one of the finest historical fantasy books ever written.</p></p>

<h2>5. <a href="/Patrick-Rothfuss/The-Name-of-the-Wind.html">The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (The Kingkiller Chronicle)</a></h2>
<p><p><strong>David Gemmell Award for Fantasy Winner:</strong> 2012 (The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear)</p><p>The Name of the Wind and Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear are the very finest examples of first-person storytelling. It&rsquo;s comparable to sitting across from someone, in a comfy chair, before a log fire, listening to them recount one of the most intricate and fascinating stories you&rsquo;ve ever heard. To quote Ursula Le Guin: &ldquo;It is a rare and great pleasure to find a fantasist writing... with true music in the words&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>

<h2>6. <a href="/Scott-Lynch/The-Lies-of-Locke-Lamora.html">The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch (The Gentleman Bastard Sequence)</a></h2>
<p><p>Scott Lynch&rsquo;s trilogy features wonderful characters, plot and camaraderie, all set within a setting beautifully inspired by ancient Venice. It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, often shocking but ultimately &ndash; and frequently - heart-warming. If you are looking for fantasy novels with relatable thieves and rogues then the Gentlemen Bastards are perfect for you.&nbsp;</p></p>

<h2>7. <a href="/Neil-Gaiman/American-Gods.html">American Gods by Neil Gaiman</a></h2>
<p><p>American Gods manages to broach several genre barriers all the while making it look as if Gaiman was creating his own genre. The end result is very much like creating a new species of rose; you take those qualities from other roses that you want, and then splice them all together. The outcome is beautiful.</p></p>

<h2>8. <a href="/NK-Jemisin/The-Fifth-Season.html">The Fifth Season by NK Jemisin (The Broken Earth)</a></h2>
<p><p>Reading the Broken Earth trilogy can be a brutal, painful experience. There is much tragedy, despair and the characters&rsquo; futures often look nothing but bleak. But these ambitious, heartbreaking books mark a new stage in the evolution of the fantasy genre and their complexity, world-building and themes break new ground.</p></p>

<h2>9. <a href="/Ursula-Le-Guin/The-Earthsea-Quartet.html">The Earthsea Quartet by Ursula Le Guin (Earthsea Saga)</a></h2>
<p><p>The Earthsea books can be read by children and enjoyed simply for the magic, wizards, adventure and beautifully imagined world. They can also be read by adults and enjoyed for the thought-provoking ideas and themes that the books conjure. They are truly timeless, exploring human behaviour without being preaching or judgmental, encouraging readers to think deeply and form their own opinions. To quote a reader review: &ldquo;The wisdom and the quiet ancient beauty of these books grow every time I reread them.&rdquo;</p></p>

<h2>10. <a href="/Robin-Hobb/Assassins-Apprentice.html">Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb (The Farseer Trilogy)</a></h2>
<p><p>The Realm of the Elderlings is a glorious, classic fantasy combining the magic of Le Guin&#39;s The Wizard of Earthsea with the epic mastery of Tolkien&#39;s The Lord of the Rings. It is a master class of characterisation, imbued with the richest of narratives, all combining to produce one of the very finest fantasy series ever written.</p></p>

<h2>11. <a href="/Steven-Erikson/Gardens-Of-The-Moon.html">Gardens Of The Moon by Steven Erikson (A Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen)</a></h2>
<p><p>The ten novels that make up A Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen are works of great skill, imagination, ambition, depth and beauty. But not for the faint-of-heart, Erikson throws you in at the deep end and encourages you to swim. This series is one of the greatest fantasy literature achievements of the past one hundred years.</p></p>

<h2>12. <a href="/Philip-Pullman/Northern-Lights.html">Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (His Dark Materials)</a></h2>
<p><p><strong>Carnegie Medal Winner:</strong> 1995 (Northern Lights)</p><p>Imagine a world that is as alike as it is dissimilar to our own. Where huge zeppelins litter the skyline and a person&rsquo;s soul is a living breathing animal companion, or &#39;daemon&#39;. This is the wonderfully engrossing world of Lyra Belacqua. Although written for children it is equally as absorbing for any adult reader, enthralling from its very first page.</p></p>

<h2>13. <a href="/China-Mieville/Perdido-Street-Station.html">Perdido Street Station by China Mieville (New Crobuzon)</a></h2>
<p><p>Perdido Street Station is a work of art. At times horrific, beautiful, tragic, comic and even uplifting, with a plot which takes unexpected turns and twists and revelations, one of the most unique settings imaginable and above all a style of dark poetry that is truly exceptional.</p></p>
<p>Published: 2000 | World Fantasy Award Nominee: 2005 (The Iron Council), 2003 (The Scar), 2001 (Perdido Street Station) | British Fantasy Award Winner: 2003 (The Scar), 2000 (Perdido Street Station)</p>

<h2>14. <a href="/Stephen-Donaldson/Lord-Fouls-Bane.html">Lord Foul's Bane by Stephen Donaldson (Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever)</a></h2>
<p><p>Thomas Covenant is arguably one of the most famous characters in fantasy, but not all who know it love it. Whether it is due to the Covenant character himself, or simply as a response to the series as a whole, readers find themselves divided in their opinions: Some love it, some hate it. But few dismiss it. The Chronicles are a very complex piece of work but at heart a good old-fashioned tale of epic fantasy deserving of being labeled classic.</p></p>
<p>Published: 1977 | World Fantasy Award Nominee: 2005 (The Runes of the Earth), The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever (1978) | British Fantasy Award Winner: 1979 (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever) | British Fantasy Award Nominee: 1981 (The Wounded Land)</p>

<h2>15. <a href="/JK-Rowling/Harry-Potter-Philosophers-Stone.html">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by JK Rowling (Harry Potter)</a></h2>
<p><p><strong>Nestl&eacute; Smarties Book Prize Winner:</strong> 1999 (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), 1998 (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), 1997 (Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone)</p><p>The seven Harry Potter books are very well-written and laugh-out-loud funny, and it makes for an intoxicating combination. The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone is where, for young Harry Potter, it all begins. The Potter books are infused with charm and wit and adored by readers of all ages, the wizarding world a wonderful place for any reader, of any age, to escape to.</p></p>

<h2>16. <a href="/Stephen-King/The-Gunslinger.html">The Gunslinger by Stephen King (The Dark Tower series)</a></h2>
<p><p>Many who have read and enjoyed the Dark Tower series have found a companion for life. The journey for many has been one of years, if not decades. And many will have found within the series parallels to their own lives: It&rsquo;s not always gone the way they would have liked, many parts were better than others (though upon re-read these conceptions can change). This is King&rsquo;s magnum opus, he poured everything into its writing and it is a towering achievement.</p></p>

<h2>17. <a href="/Brandon-Sanderson/The-Way-of-Kings.html">The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson (The Stormlight Archive)</a></h2>
<p><p>With The Stormlight Archive, Brandon Sanderson clearly stamps his authority as the master of the &quot;Hollywood&quot; style of epic fantasy. It is hard to comprehend just how much stuff is going on and how this book impacts the wider Cosmere (the universe that ties all of Sanderson&#39;s books together). Big action set pieces of extraordinary people doing extraordinary things is exactly what many want from their epic fantasy.</p></p>

<h2>18. <a href="/CS-Lewis/The-Lion-The-Witch-And-The-Wardrobe.html">The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe by CS Lewis (The Chronicles of Narnia)</a></h2>
<p><p><strong>Carnegie Medal Winner:</strong>&nbsp;1956 (The Last Battle)</p><p>With the Chronicles of Narnia cemented himself as a master story teller and perfected writing novels that would survive the test of time and still entertain and educate children and adults everywhere to this day. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is arguably one of the finest stories in English literature from the 20th century.</p></p>

<h2>19. <a href="/Joe-Abercrombie/The-Blade-Itself.html">The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie (The First Law)</a></h2>
<p><p>The First Law trilogy was a real game changer for the fantasy genre. It worked in shades of grey. It makes the reader like characters they should possibly, really dislike. And dislike characters they should possibly, really like. The dialogue is witty and often the cause of out-loud laughter. It&rsquo;s a captivating read and has everything a fantasy fan could wish for. Any books that can add humour to torture scenes has something special going on.</p></p>

<h2>20. <a href="/Robert-Jordan/The-Eye-of-the-World.html">The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time)</a></h2>
<p><p>The Wheel of Time is one of the most popular and influential fantasy epics ever written. It puts the epic in epic fantasy, a hugely ambitious undertaking that redefined a genre. This skillfully written fourteen book series is filled with unforgettable characters and set in a world steeped in rich history and legend.</p></p>

<h2>21. <a href="/Terry-Pratchett/Good-Omens.html">Good Omens by Terry Pratchett</a></h2>
<p><p>Good Omens is one of the funniest works of fiction ever. Pratchett and Gaiman have managed to create a story that weaves together large doses of satire, cynicism, slapstick and wacky unconventional humour into a cohesive yet surprisingly accurate observation of human life all over the world. The characters, one of the biggest strengths in this book, bring a lot of charm and humour to the book. This collaboration between two fine fantasy authors is nothing short of brilliant.</p></p>

<h2>22. <a href="/TH-White/The-Once-And-Future-King.html">The Once And Future King by TH White</a></h2>
<p><p>Once upon a time, a young boy called &ldquo;Wart&rdquo; was tutored by a magician named Merlyn in preparation for a future he couldn&rsquo;t possibly imagine. A future in which he would ally himself with the greatest knights, love a legendary queen and unite a country dedicated to chivalrous values...&nbsp;The Once and Future King is a serious work, delightful and witty, yet very sombre overall. The volume published as The Once and Future King is actually four works separately composed over about 20 years.&nbsp;</p></p>

<h2>23. <a href="/Guy-Gavriel-Kay/Under-Heaven.html">Under Heaven by Guy Gavriel Kay</a></h2>
<p><p>Under Heaven, inspired by the Tang Dynasty of Ancient China, is as beautiful and enriching a novel as you could possibly wish for. Kay is an expert storyteller, his writing style strong and fluid, his exposition always necessary and worked seamlessly into the narrative. He has successfully re-imagined Ancient China in the same accessible and absorbing way that he previously achieved with medieval France, Ottoman Spain and Renaissance Italy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>

<h2>24. <a href="/NK-Jemisin/The-Hundred-Thousand-Kingdoms.html">The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms by NK Jemisin (The Inheritance Trilogy)</a></h2>

<h2>25. <a href="/Brandon-Sanderson/The-Final-Empire.html">The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn)</a></h2>
<p><p>In his Mistborn series Brandon Sanderson has written one of the seminal fantasy stories of his generation. Compelling and flawlessly executed with exquisite skill, the enormous magnitude of the story being told showcases the breathtaking imagination at work here. Themes like religion and death are dealt with, power and helplessness, corruption and goodness. Weaved together like a master basket maker, this story lets you grow attached too, love, and lose, characters that you never thought would be lost.</p></p>

<h2>26. <a href="/Gene-Wolf/The-Shadow-of-the-Torturer.html">The Shadow of the Torturer by Gene Wolf (Book of the New Sun)</a></h2>
<p><p>The Book of the New Sun is a science fantasy classic that improves with every read. Too often overlooked, possibly due to being dense in allegory and symbolism, the joy of coming to understand Wolfe&rsquo;s craft is part of the joy of reading it. The lead character Severan, is an unreliable narrator, and this adds another layer of complexity. If you&rsquo;re a fan of both science fiction and fantasy, it is a must-read.</p></p>

<h2>27. <a href="/Fonda-Lee/Jade-City.html">Jade City by Fonda Lee (The Green Bone Saga)</a></h2>
<p><p>Emotionally shocking moments, intricate and otherworldly fight scenes, and lots of loyalty, honour and tradition. Jade City is an epic, unique and often unforgiving gangster fantasy narrative intertwined with glimpses of hope and goodness. The haunting nature of the world is also mixed with betrayals and a huge death toll. Recommended.</p></p>

<h2>28. <a href="/Raymond-E-Feist/Magician.html">Magician by Raymond E Feist (Riftwar Saga)</a></h2>
<p><p>Feist&#39;s Magician is one of the best known and well read fantasy books; it&nbsp;is a powerful and memorable book that any reader who derives pleasure from reading epic fantasy should read being&nbsp;classic fantasy imbued with many elements of originality.&nbsp;The character development is excellent and the reading experience effortless. In 2003 Magician was voted the 89th most popular book of all time in the BBC&#39;s Big Read Top 100. I found the first read of this book to be one of those special moments when you are reading a book that has shaped the fantasy fantasy landscape as it now appears.</p></p>

<h2>29. <a href="/Guy-Gavriel-Kay/Tigana.html">Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay</a></h2>
<p><p>I once read an interview with Guy Gavriel Kay where he explained his approach to writing. He said that he wrote what he needed to write and then went over it a second time, adding layers and textures, making improvements, rather like a painter. And then he repeated the process for a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and then eighth time. And this is why his writing is so good, it&#39;s not just natural talent, which he has in abundance, but attention to detail and hard, painstaking work. It pays off and in Tigana he wrote a book that influenced me as much as The Lord of the Rings when I was a youngster. It is a book I hold very dear. But Kay is the second Canadian on this list and although they may appear the nicest, politest people on the planet I secretely fear plans for world domination, so I&#39;ll keep on eye of the Empire of Canadia&#39;s ratio.&nbsp;</p></p>

<h2>30. <a href="/Peter-S-Beagle/The-Last-Unicorn.html">The Last Unicorn by Peter S Beagle</a></h2>
<p><p>The Last Unicorn is one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time. Its lyrical writing, it&rsquo;s memorable and very human characters, and its exploration of mortality, immortality, and the meeting of the two never fail to move. The novel deals in a very deep and profound way with love, and loss, and the value of love; which in the case of the unicorn becomes important enough to surrender immortality to possess. There are also recurring themes of loss and grief, and the contemplation of the meaning and purpose of life (and death).</p></p>

<h2>31. <a href="/Richard-Adams/Watership-Down.html">Watership Down by Richard Adams</a></h2>
<p><p>Watership Down is a book which will always hold a special place in my heart. It has captivated and moved me for over three decades and I do not believe this will change for what I hope will be a further three. It has the elements that I enjoy in a story: a quest, the journey, plus the bravery, belief and inability to accept defeat. The rabbit characters are glorious: the nerviously intelligent Fiver and his kind, loyal brother Hazel. The no-nonsense Bigwig, the controlling Woundwort and the ingenious Blackberry - all are rich and wonderful to spend time with. Is it fantasy? Google lists it as&nbsp;Fairy tale, Fantasy Fiction, Adventure fiction. Good enough for me. How many talking rabbits have you met?</p></p>

<h2>32. <a href="/Lev-Grossman/The-Magicians.html">The Magicians by Lev Grossman (The Magicians series)</a></h2>
<p><p>The fantasy genre always needs an author to come along a show it in a different light and this is exactly what has Grossman has done with The Magicians. He has injected sexual tension and questionable morals into a school for wizards and the result is a rousing, perceptive and multifaceted coming of age story that is both bright and beguiling. The Magicians is a perfect fantasy book for older teens that will find that the author understands them, and their feelings, possibly better than they do themselves.</p></p>

<h2>33. <a href="/Lewis-Carroll/Alices-Adventures-in-Wonderland.html">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll</a></h2>
<p><p>Alice in Wonderland was Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s first novel and its fantasy plot, humorous rhymes and brilliant use of nonsense was revolutionary. Nineteenth-century children&rsquo;s writing usually served moral or educational purpose, but Alice was written firmly and purely for the amusement of children. Critical response was lukewarm, but the book was still a great success, and remains a hugely influential classic of children&rsquo;s literature.</p></p>

The rocket-powered narrative tricks you without being merely tricksy, and is both modern and timeless&quot;&nbsp;Neon</p><p>&quot;A funny thriller for readers who are about ten years of age or wish they were ... Readers of a nervous disposition should be prepared to skim rapidly over the Zoo of Death episode or stick to fiction meant for grown-ups&quot;&nbsp;Spectator</p></p>

<p><p>The Divine Cities trilogy is quite unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever read before. It treats its audience with the same respect and consideration as it shares with its cast. It is a rich, lovingly-crafted world that is both thematically complex and wonderfully entertaining. Shara, Mulaghesh and Sigrud have all been ensconced in my personal Fictional Character Hall of Fame, and I will miss them dearly. If you&rsquo;re looking to discover something new, something original, and something memorable, then this is the series you&rsquo;re looking for.</p></p>

<h2>40. <a href="/Helene-Wecker/The-Golem-and-the-Djinni.html">The Golem and the Djinni by Helene Wecker</a></h2>
<p><p>Helene Wecker writes elegantly and fluently, her characters are constantly fascinating and exploring their histories is a joy. The main setting and the narrative evoke wonderful images of nineteenth century New York and we, as the fortunate reader, get to experience Jewish and Arabic folklore fundamental to the book&rsquo;s being. Many authors have written about a golem, many have written about a djinni, but few have brought them both together in a story so seamlessly. The Golem and the Djinni is first rate historical fantasy fiction that consistently delights; a charming love story with pleasing emotional depth.</p></p>

<h2>48. <a href="/Terry-Brooks/The-Sword-of-Shannara.html">The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks (The Shannara Trilogy)</a></h2>
<p><p>Long ago, the world of the Four Lands was torn apart by the wars of ancient Evil. But in the Vale, the half-human, half-elfin Shea Ohmsford now lives in peace - until the mysterious, forbidding figure of the druid Allanon appears, to reveal that the supposedly long dead Warlock Lord lives again. Shea must embark upon the elemental quest to find the only weapon powerful enough to keep the creatures of darkness at bay: the fabled Sword of Shannara.</p><p>&quot;And while I will agree that Brooks draws inspiration from Tolkien, he doesn&#39;t copy him. The reason I linger on this is to hopefully, impress upon you an open mind to reading this book. Do not cross this book off your &ldquo;to read&rdquo; list because you&#39;ve heard people knock it. Similarly, do not go into reading this book attempting to cross reference everything back to some other work. This is a book that deserves being critiqued on its own merit.&quot;</p></p>

<p><p>Prince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence was a book steeped in controversy - a book that seemed to have divided the Science Fiction and Fantasy community with regards to what is acceptable for people to like and enjoy. A confronting story, deliberately so, that follows a 13 year old boy named Jorg who leads a gang of marauders as they pillage their way across the countryside. Jorg is a sociopath, a willing participant, and readers get to experience the world through his damaged viewpoint. Readers get to see, through Jorg&#39;s eyes, the cold apathy with which he dispatches his enemies. It is discomforting. But Prince of Thorns is a fantastic tale of one boy&rsquo;s fight for control in a world threatening to engulf him.</p></p>

<p><p>All the Birds in the Sky is an intense emotional roller-coaster that flits between genres, using both sci-fi and fantasy to get its message across and although it does pit them against each other, the novel never says one is better than the other, each has its place in this story and it is by both of these working together that the best outcome will be found. All the Birds in the Sky is also a very human story focusing on the confusion and mistrust that can come from not understanding the unknown.</p></p>

It is a testament to&nbsp;Kuang&rsquo;s skill as a writer to establish such a strong connection with her protagonists that the impact of the events in third act hit as hard as they do.</p></p>

I recommend this to readers who enjoy female driven fantasy that is also carefully paced like the works of Robin&nbsp;Hobb, Tad Williams and Chris Wooding.</p></p>

<h2>64. <a href="/Ann-Leckie/The-Raven-Tower.html">The Raven Tower by Ann Leckie</a></h2>
<p><p>Another 10/10 book and the most recently published book to appear on this list, published as it was in 2019. Ann Leckie first came to our attention with her highly-regarded science fiction books. When she turned her hand to fantasy she produced, in the words of the book&#39;s reviewer, Joshua: A magisterial&nbsp;tour de force&nbsp;of subverted narrative expectations that wrestles with what it means to find identity as a human, and as a god. Unlike anything being written, Ann Leckie will likely be remembered as a literary pioneer, and not as similar to someone else. A masterpiece of storytelling that leaves a willing reader humbled,&nbsp;The Raven Tower&nbsp;is quite simply the best book of the year &ndash; mighty, subtle, captivating, unputdownable.</p></p>

<h2>65. <a href="/Alix-E-Harrow/The-10000-Doors-of-January.html">The 10,000 Doors of January by Alix E Harrow</a></h2>
<p><p>It is a rare thing to relate to a book&rsquo;s character in such a way that similar situations evoke empathy across your lives. Enough parallels can be drawn to feel almost as if the book is catered specifically toward you in some existential way. I have not read much portal fantasy, but I have always felt a feeling of smothered repression through my youth that has tamped down my will to explore. Instead, my portals to elsewhere revealed themselves in books and stories at an early age, and they&rsquo;ve been with me ever since. Alix Harrow captures this feeling of finding oneself through the stories we share in her stunning and unforgettable debut novel The 10,000 Doors of January. It is a beautifully written and lovingly crafted adventure about the strength of love, the importance of stories, and the timeless power of words.</p></p>

<h2>67. <a href="/Graham-Joyce/Some-Kind-of-Fairy-Tale.html">Some Kind of Fairy Tale by Graham Joyce</a></h2>
<p><p>Twenty years ago , sixteen year old Tara Martin took a walk into the mysterious Outwoods in the Charnwood Forest and never came back. Extensive searches and police investigations find no trace and her family is forced to accept the unthinkable. Then on Christmas day Tara arrives at her parents&#39; door, dishevelled, unapologetic and not looking a day older than when she left. It seems like a miracle and Tara&#39;s parents are delighted, but something about her story doesn&#39;t add up. When she claims that she was abducted by the fairies, her brother Peter starts to think she might have lost her sanity. But as Tara&#39;s tale unfolds, those who loved and missed her begin to wonder whether there is some truth to her account of the last two decades.</p></p>

But her childhood nemesis won&rsquo;t set her free without a service.</p><p>Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will be become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon&rsquo;s sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.</p><p>Of course, some things are better left dead.</p></p>

<h2>71. <a href="/William-Horwood/Duncton-Wood.html">Duncton Wood by William Horwood (The Duncton Chronicles)</a></h2>
<p><p>Some authors write beautifuly and can induce an almost meditive state in the reader. Tolkien, Hobb, Le Guin, Martin can achieve this, and so can William Horwood. There are two books on the site that generate an effusive outpouring of love from readers, two books which will be well know to some but perhaps not as widely known as many books on this list, they are Swan Song by Robert McCammon and Duncton Wood. It is the moving love story of Bracken and Rebecca and the trials they must face and overcome to be as one. It is unfortunate that this work must be compared to Watership Down but that is the only book with which I can really compare it to in terms of story-line and excellence. Read my review and the reader reviews below it if you want to get a real sense of how highly this book is regarded.</p></p>

<p><p>Terry Goodkind has created a consice, intelligent book that is believable from the start. This is fantasy that is definately aimed at the adult.&nbsp;It is evident that Terry Goodkind has strong political and social views that he is keen to get across in his books. Rather than finding this spoilt the narrative, I found it healthy reading a book that makes you think about what the author is trying to say. I found that Ursula Le Guin&#39;s works had the same effect on me.</p></p>

<p><p>If you are a fan of trains, history, or London, then this book is definitely for you. Gaiman once again, just like he did in American Gods, shows an uncanny research ability, matched with his inimitable writing style. We are soon introduced to a mass of underground railway stations, and a group of people that, unbeknownst to London Above, are living rather content lives beneath their feet. A bit of mythology, a bit of fantasy, a bit of urban drama and a whole lot of London makes this book a definite must read.</p></p>

<p><p>Sei, November, Ludov, and Oleg -- four people unknown to each other but united by grief and their obsession with the city of Palimpsest. Located beyond the human realm, Palimpsest is accessible only by those who sleep after generating the energy which comes from sex. Once anyone arrives in the city, they indulge in sense pleasures and are able to obtain their innermost desires -- two things which ensure that Palimpsest visitors return.</p><p>&quot;Like other Cathryn Valente books (Orphan&#39;s Tales, In the Garden of Coin and Spice), this poignant poetic work is a feast for the mind. Palimpsest is the gift of a fairy tale wrapped in an allegory and tied with a mystical ribbon. A gift that readers can enjoy again and again.&quot; <strong>Fantasy Book Review</strong></p></p>

Chabon&rsquo;s world and its collapsing-star reality you completely buy. The analogs of human behaviour are poetic, tenderly ironic and brilliantly designed. Chess is key, but not in such a fashion that it bans the non-chess playing reader. And there is a seemingly self-perpetuating sense of devilish humour that had me choking every other page.</p></p>

<p><p>It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula. Peppered with familiar characters from Victorian history and fiction, the novel tells the story of vampire Genevi&egrave;ve Dieudonn&eacute; and Charles Beauregard of the Diogenes Club as they strive to solve the mystery of the Ripper murders. Anno Dracula is a rich and panoramic tale, combining horror, politics, mystery and romance to create a unique and compelling alternate history. Acclaimed novelist Kim Newman explores the darkest depths of a reinvented Victorian London. This brand-new edition of the bestselling novel contains unique bonus material, including a new afterword from Kim Newman, annotations, articles and alternate endings to the original novel.</p><p>&quot;Kim Newman&#39;s Anno Dracula is back in print, and we must celebrate. It was the first mash-up of literature, history and vampires, and now, in a world in which vampires are everywhere, it&#39;s still the best, and its bite is just as sharp. Compulsory reading, commentary, and mindgame: glorious.&quot; <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong></p><p>&quot;The book succeeds not just as horror but also as a thriller and detective novel combining politics, romance and history. Newman has produced an excellently crafted, well-plotted, fast-paced, sure-footed, incident-packed and macabre thrill fest.&quot; <strong>Fantasy Book Review</strong></p></p>

<h2>88. <a href="/G-Willow-Wilson/Alif-the-Unseen.html">Alif the Unseen by G Willow Wilson</a></h2>
<p><p>He calls himself Alif - few people know his real name - a young man born in a Middle Eastern city that straddles the ancient and modern worlds. When Alif meets the aristocratic Intisar, he believes he has found love. But their relationship has no future - Intisar is promised to another man and her family&#39;s honour must be satisfied. As a remembrance, Intisar sends the heartbroken Alif a mysterious book. Entitled The Thousand and One Days, Alif discovers that this parting gift is a door to another world - a world from a very different time, when old magic was in the ascendant and the djinn walked amongst us. With the book in his hands, Alif finds himself drawing attention - far too much attention - from both men and djinn. Thus begins an adventure that takes him through the crumbling streets of a once-beautiful city, to uncover the long-forgotten mysteries of the Unseen. Alif is about to become a fugitive in both the corporeal and incorporeal worlds. And he is about to unleash a destructive power that will change everything and everyone - starting with Alif himself.</p><p>&quot;I would highly recommend this book to anybody who like a ripping yarn, whether they are into fantasy or not because this is more of a thriller with echoes of the computer acrobatics seen in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, which I find really interesting, but set against an exotic landscape that really comes to life. You can feel and smell the duststorm as it sweeps over the houses, seeping its way in through the cracks, the panic as The Hand, an unbending, alien force, closes in, and the awkwardness of a young American scholar who tries to help Alif but is so clearly out of place. Overall, a sumptuous, colourful and many-layered novel.&quot; <strong>Fantasy Book Review</strong></p></p>

<p><p>Weaveworld is a true epic of a story &ndash; a whirlwind of base instincts and heights of imagination that brings together fantasy and horror, whilst grounding the fantastical in a recognisable, mundane, suburban England.</p></p>
<p>Published: 1987 | World Fantasy Award Nominee: 1988</p>

<h2>93. <a href="/VE-Schwab/A-Darker-Shade-of-Magic.html">A Darker Shade of Magic by VE Schwab (A Darker Shade of Magic)</a></h2>
<p><p>Most people only know one London; but what if there were several? Kell is one of the last Travelers - magicians with a rare ability to travel between parallel Londons. There&rsquo;s Grey London, dirty and crowded and without magic, home to the mad king George III. There&rsquo;s Red London, where life and magic are revered. Then, White London, ruled by whoever has murdered their way to the throne. But once upon a time, there was Black London...</p><p>&quot;Like the best books I have read, V. E. Schwab has left me wanting to read more about these characters that have come alive in my mind.&quot;</p></p>

<h2>94. <a href="/Katherine-Addison/The-Goblin-Emperor.html">The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison</a></h2>
<p><p>From the quietly sad story of a lonely young man out of his depth, to the equally quietly triumphant story of a hero who has accepted himself, learned to cope and promises to do a great deal of good for others, this&nbsp;is a story with magic, airships and elves set around a very ritualistic royal court. In some ways The Goblin Emperor is one of the most grittily hopeful books I&rsquo;ve read for quite a significant while, and one I&rsquo;d definitely agree deserves its accolade.</p></p>

<h2>95. <a href="/Claire-North/The-Sudden-Appearance-of-Hope.html">The Sudden Appearance of Hope by Claire North</a></h2>
<p><p>The Sudden Appearance of Hope is an excellent novel, one that looks at complex themes with much more depth before providing a biased social commentary.&nbsp;There is barely any escapism to be found here. This book will engage you with the prevalent social issues of today (mid-2016), making you pause and think about our pursuit of perfection as defined by Hollywood and the mainstream media.</p></p>

<h2>96. <a href="/Ed-McDonald/Blackwing.html">Blackwing by Ed McDonald (The Raven’s Mark)</a></h2>
<p><p>This is quite a dark story full of gritty and macabre deaths aplenty with a good, but not an overwhelming amount of adrenaline fueling action. Certain sections are superbly intense though and this book is highly unpredictable. It features twists, betrayal, political disputes and half the time when I thought I had analysed where the story was going, I was then blindsided or completely shocked by a revelation. The publisher stated that this as being &quot;gritty epic fantasy for fans of Mark Lawrence and Scott Lynch&quot; and I cannot disagree.</p></p>

<h2>97. <a href="/Robert-Jackson-Bennett/Foundryside.html">Foundryside by Robert Jackson Bennett (Founders)</a></h2>
<p><p>It&rsquo;s rare that a story catches me off guard with so many inventive and thrilling ideas, yet still only scratches the surface of the directions it could take. The potential here is so vast; I see these ideas as prime material to turn into its own RPG world, or spinoff novels, or fill-in-the-blank. Great writing, characters of substance, and thoughtful exploration of original ideas elevates&nbsp;Foundryside&nbsp;into rare territory.</p></p>

<h2>98. <a href="/Anna-Smaill/The-Chimes.html">The Chimes by Anna Smaill</a></h2>
<p><p>The Chimes is one of the most difficult, and yet most rewarding books I&rsquo;ve read for quite some time. Breaking so many rules of writing to explore its central premise, yet blending together dark poetry, a truly unique post-apocalyptic world, love, music and memory into one great symphonic whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts, and an experience which you won&rsquo;t easily forget.</p></p>

<h2>99. <a href="/Evan-Winter/The-Rage-Of-Dragons.html">The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter (The Burning)</a></h2>
<p><p>The Rage of Dragons explodes at a breakneck pace. Complex characters, dragons, revenge, ALL THE STABBY-STABBY-STAB-STAB. I adored everything about this book! The cover, the chapter titles, the maps, the wee dragon on the spine, the notes from Winter at the back.,. it was just&nbsp;phenomenal. Truly. What a brilliant debut!</p></p>

<h2>100. <a href="/Seanan-McGuire/Middlegame.html">Middlegame by Seanan McGuire</a></h2>
<p><p>Alternate timelines, manifestations, Hands of Glory, alchemy, Doctrine of Ethos and immortality and and and GODDAMN. McGuire provides a clinic in storytelling with Middlegame. This is her magnum opus (so far!) It&rsquo;s magical... truly magical. I could not love it more!!!</p></p>
